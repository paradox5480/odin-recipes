<img src="/home/harveylamb/repos/odin-recipes/Bacon-Wrapped-Jalapeno-Poppers-Recipe-1.jpg">
<a>These jalapeño poppers are creamy in the middle with crispy bacon on the outside. They're easy to make and taste so much better than traditional poppers.</a>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ol>½ cup cream cheese</ol>
<ol>½ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</ol>
<ol>12 jalapeno peppers, halved lengthwise, seeds and membranes removed</ol>
<ol>12 slices bacon</ol>
<h2>How to make:</h2>
<ol>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</ol>
<ol>Mix cream cheese and Cheddar cheese together in a bowl until evenly blended. Fill each jalapeño half with cheese mixture. Put halves back together and wrap each stuffed pepper with a slice of bacon. Arrange bacon-wrapped peppers on the prepared baking sheet.</ol>
<ol>Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crispy, 25 to 35 minutes.</ol>
