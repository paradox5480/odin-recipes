<a>This is a lasagna.</a>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>For the meat sauce</h3>
<!--Surely there's a more efficient way to make lists in HTML. This hurts my eyes.-->
<ol>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</ol>
<ol>1 pound ground beef chuck</ol>
<ol>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</ol>
<ol>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</ol>
<ol>2 cloves garlic, minced</ol>
<ol>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</ol>
<ol>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</ol>
<ol>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</ol>
<ol>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</ol>
<ol>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</ol>
<ol>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</ol>
<ol>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</ol>
<ol>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</ol>
<ol>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</ol>
<ol>Salt</ol>
<h3>To assemble the lasagna</h3>
<ol>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)</ol>
<ol>15 ounces ricotta cheese</ol>
<ol>1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</ol>
<ol>1/4 pound (4 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</ol>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</ol>
<ol>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</ol>
<ol>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</ol>
<ol>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</ol>
